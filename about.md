### More Information

I’m Iain. I’m a friendly and outgoing individual with a thirst for learning new things. I come from a background of grassroots 
campaigning with strong roots in customer services, research and PR.

Previously, I worked for an MSP as Press and Research Officer. After being made redundant I moved IPSOS MORI where I carried out
Business to Business and Business to Consumer Market Research.

During this period I started a family and at the start of 2020 I left IPSOS to pursue another passion of mine, coding.

This lead to me joining CodeClan, to undertake the Professional Software Development Course. The course was tough and taxing,  
but I absolutely loved it. I'm now keen to take my newfound skills and build on them within the tech industry.

My dream would be to combine my love of coding with making a real difference in the world, be it in the third sector, grassroots 
movements or other social ventures. Owing to a Master Degree in Political Research I have a keen interest in data and data visualization, 
so I'd love to explore that sector more.
