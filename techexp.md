### CodeClan – Sep 2020 to March 2021
## Professional Software Development Course. 

I'm a new software and web developer that has recently completed CodeClans excellent Professional Software Development 
Course, I'm keen to build on the knowledge that I gained there. During my time at CodeClan I gained key skills in both Backend 
and Frontend development, from building Single Page Apps using React to creating Backend servers with Node.js and Java.

I have a good working knowledge of NPM libraries, working with JSON and fetching data from APIs. I also have a great 
working knowledge of HTML, usually however, I’d use MaterialUI or another component rather than handwriting CSS. 
In addition, CodeClan has given me the skills I need to learn and pick up new languages quickly, 
having learned Python, JavaScript and Java in my time there.


# Key Skills Gained (so far)

- Python and Flask
- JavaScript – React, Express and RESTful APIs
- JAVA and SpringBoot
- Git and GitHib – Version management and Control.
- PostgreSQL and MongoBD
- HTML and CSS
- Agile and Scrum


# My CodeClan Projects 

**Veterinary Appointment System - https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/Vet_Project**

This was my first project built at CodeClan, during week five of the course. This was a Solo Project completed in 4 days. 
It has full CRUD functionality using PostgreSQL. It runs on a Flask server with a Python backend. The aim of the project 
was to design an appointment system that allowed animals to be checked-in to the vet. These animals are linked to owners 
registered with the vet.

**Stock Trader - https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/Stock_Trader_Project_JS**

Second project built at CodeClan. This was a group project, completed over 5 days, with two other people. The project has 
CRUD actions using MongoDB. It uses a RESTful API connection to Google Finance and Alpha Vantage and utilises ChartJS to display 
stock data. It’s built primarily using React and Express. 

**Super Hero App -  https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/FP_Superhero_App**

For my final CodeClan project I took the decision to attempt this solo as I wanted to consolidate my knowledge 
of React and play around with Java. The project isn’t fully finished the version I presented uses MongoDB to store 
data that is pulled from an API using streams. This API data is then built back in to Data Transfer Object to be saved in the database.

The front end uses a mixture of bootstrap and CSS on top of a React App. It also has pagination which I coded out, before 
realising bootstrap had it built in. As of now the app displays a hero database and biography section. Future plans 
are to turn it in a fully-fledged battle app. The app was constructed over period of 4 days.
