### Technical Experience.

### CodeClan – Sep 2020 to March 2021
## Professional Software Development Course. 

I'm a new software and web developer that has recently completed CodeClans excellent Professional Software Development 
Course. keen to build on the knowledge that I gained there. During my time at CodeClan I gained key skill in both Backend 
and Frontend development. From building Single Page Apps using React, to creating Backend servers with Node.js and Java.

I have a good working knowledge of NPM libraries, working with JSON and fetching data from APIs. I also have a great 
working knowledge of HTML, usually however, I’d use MaterialUI or another component rather than handwriting CSS. 
In, addition CodeClan has given me the skills I need to learned and pick up new languages quickly, 
having learned Python, JavaScript and Java in my time there.

# My CodeClan Projects 

**Veterinary Appointment System - https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/Vet_Project**

This was my first project built at CodeClan, during week five of the course. This was a Solo Project completed in 4 days. It has full CURD functionality using PostgreSQL, it runs on a Flask server with a Python backend. The aim of the project was to design an appointment system that allowed animals to be checked in, these animals are linked to owners registered.

**Stock Trader - https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/Stock_Trader_Project_JS**

Second project built at CodeClan, this was a group project, completed over 5 days, with two other people. The project has CRUD actions using MongoDB, it uses a RESTful API, to Google Finance and Alpha Vantage, and utilises ChartJS to display stock data. It’s built primary using JavaScript react and Express. 

**Super Hero App -  https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/FP_Superhero_App**

My third and final CodeClan project, I took the decision to attempt this project Solo as I wanted to consolidate my Knowledge of React and play around with Java. Although the project isn’t full finished, the version I presented, use a MongoDB to store data that is pulled from an API, using streams, this API data is then built back in to Data Transfer Object to be saved in the database.

The front end uses a mixture of bootstrap and CSS on top of a React App, it also has pagination which I coded out, before realising bootstrap had it built in. As of right now the app displayed a hero database and biography section. Future plans are to turn it in a fully-fledged battle app. This app was constructed over a 4 day period.
