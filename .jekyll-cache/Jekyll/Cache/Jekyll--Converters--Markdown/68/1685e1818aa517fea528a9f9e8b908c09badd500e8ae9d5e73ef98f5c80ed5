<h2 id="professional-software-development-course">Professional Software Development Course.</h2>

<p>I’m a new software and web developer that has recently completed CodeClans excellent Professional Software Development 
Course. keen to build on the knowledge that I gained there. During my time at CodeClan I gained key skill in both Backend 
and Frontend development. From building Single Page Apps using React, to creating Backend servers with Node.js and Java.</p>

<p>I have a good working knowledge of NPM libraries, working with JSON and fetching data from APIs. I also have a great 
working knowledge of HTML, usually however, I’d use MaterialUI or another component rather than handwriting CSS. 
In, addition CodeClan has given me the skills I need to learned and pick up new languages quickly, 
having learned Python, JavaScript and Java in my time there.</p>

<h1 id="my-codeclan-projects">My CodeClan Projects</h1>

<p><strong>Veterinary Appointment System - https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/Vet_Project</strong></p>

<p>This was my first project built at CodeClan, during week five of the course. This was a Solo Project completed in 4 days. It has full CURD functionality using PostgreSQL, it runs on a Flask server with a Python backend. The aim of the project was to design an appointment system that allowed animals to be checked in, these animals are linked to owners registered.</p>

<p><strong>Stock Trader - https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/Stock_Trader_Project_JS</strong></p>

<p>Second project built at CodeClan, this was a group project, completed over 5 days, with two other people. The project has CRUD actions using MongoDB, it uses a RESTful API, to Google Finance and Alpha Vantage, and utilises ChartJS to display stock data. It’s built primary using JavaScript react and Express.</p>

<p><strong>Super Hero App -  https://github.com/Iain-Forbes/FP_Superhero_App</strong></p>

<p>My third and final CodeClan project, I took the decision to attempt this project Solo as I wanted to consolidate my Knowledge of React and play around with Java. Although the project isn’t full finished, the version I presented, use a MongoDB to store data that is pulled from an API, using streams, this API data is then built back in to Data Transfer Object to be saved in the database.</p>

<p>The front end uses a mixture of bootstrap and CSS on top of a React App, it also has pagination which I coded out, before realising bootstrap had it built in. As of right now the app displayed a hero database and biography section. Future plans are to turn it in a fully-fledged battle app. This app was constructed over a 4 day period.</p>
