<p>Iâ€™m Iain. Iâ€™m a friendly and outgoing individual with a thirst for learning new things. I come from a background of grassroots 
campaigning with strong roots in customer services, research and PR.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked for an MSP as Press and Research Officer. After being made redundant I moved IPSOS MORI where I carried out
Business to Business and Business to Consumer Market Research.</p>

<p>During this period I started a family and at the start of 2020 I left IPSOS to pursue another passion of mine, coding.</p>

<p>This lead to me joining CodeClan, to undertake the Professional Software Development Course. The course was tough and taxing. I loved every minute of it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m now keen to take my newfound skills and build on them within the tech industry.</p>

<p>My dream would be to combine my love of coding with making a real difference in the world, be it in the third sector, grassroots 
movements or other social ventures. Owing to a Master Degree in Political Research I have a keen interest in data and data visualization, 
so Iâ€™d love to explore that sector more.</p>
